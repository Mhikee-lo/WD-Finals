## Overview


Personal Website Project
This web repository is an evidence of what the writers have learned and the practical aspect of what has been taught throughout the term for web design. Here describes how the theoretical knowledge has been utilized in the actual technical programs. This README is an instruction how our work can be used and aimed to shows some real-world examples of the solution that we have implemented as well as our ability to comprehend the course materials in the practical context. This project entails developing an individual webpage, which is to be greater than one page in length, that demonstrates the skill as well as knowledge required in HTML and CSS. Basically, the website is fully interactive, which entails possible navigations and buttons that direct to other pages or even repositories on Github.


Guiding Question:
- In what way can we be able to use the things that were learnt through out the Web Design course in developing a functional and attractive personal home page?

### Key Components

- MultiPage Website and Infos


### Technology

![CSS](https://img.shields.io/badge/CSS-1572B6?style=for-the-badge&logo=css3&logoColor=white)


## Rules, Practices and Principles
1. Always use `WD-` in the front of the Title of the Project for the Subject followed by your custom naming.
2. Do not rename any .html files; always use `index.html` as the filename.
3. Place Files in their respective folders.
4. All file naming are in camel case.
   - Camel case is naming format where there is no white space in separation of each words, the first word is in all lower case while the succeding words first letter are in upper followed by lower cased letters.
   - ex.: buttonAnimatedStyle.css
5. Use only `External CSS`.
6. Renaming of Pages folder names are a must, and relates to what it is doing or data it holding.
7. File Structure to follow below.

```
WD-ProjectName
└─ assets
|   └─ css
|   |   └─ style.css
|   └─ img
|   |   └─ fileWith.jpeg/.jpg/.webp/.png
|   └─ js
|       └─ script.js
└─ pages
|  └─ pageName
|     └─ assets
|     |  └─ css

|     |  └─ js
